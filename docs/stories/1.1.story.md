# Story 1.1: Update Build Configuration and Compile with JDK 11

**Status:** Draft

**Story:**
As a developer, I want to update the build configuration to use JDK 11 and compile the application, so that I can identify and fix any compilation issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `build.gradle` file is updated to use Java 11.
2.  The application compiles successfully with JDK 11.
3.  No new compilation warnings are introduced.

    *   Framework: Spring Boot 2.0.2.RELEASE [Source: docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack]
*   **File Locations:**
    *   The `build.gradle` file is located in the project root. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Source Tree]
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   No specific testing requirements for this story, as it is focused on compilation. Subsequent stories will cover testing. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Test Strategy]
