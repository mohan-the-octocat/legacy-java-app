# Story 1.2: Run All Existing Tests with JDK 11

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to run all existing automated tests with JDK 11,
**so that** I can identify and fix any test failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All unit and integration tests pass when run with JDK 11.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Update local development environment to use JDK 11.
- [ ] Configure the project's build system (Gradle) to use JDK 11 for running tests.
- [ ] Execute all existing unit tests with JDK 11.
- [ ] Execute all existing integration tests with JDK 11.
- [ ] Document any test failures encountered.
- [ ] Analyze test failures to determine root cause (e.g., API changes, library incompatibilities).
- [ ] (AC: 1) Ensure all tests pass when run with JDK 11.

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test file location:** Tests are located in `src/test/java`.
- **Test standards:** The project uses JUnit and Spring Test.
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** JUnit and Spring Test.
- **Specific testing requirements for this story:** All existing unit and integration tests must pass when run with JDK 11.

**Previous Story Insights:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
**Data Models:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
**API Specifications:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
**Component Specifications:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
**File Locations:**
- `build.gradle`: Needs to be configured to use JDK 11 for tests.
- `src/test/java`: Location of existing test files.
**Technical Constraints:**
- The application is currently built with Java 1.8. The goal is to run tests with JDK 11.
- The build tool is Gradle.
- CI/CD uses Travis CI, which will need to be updated to use JDK 11 for testing.
