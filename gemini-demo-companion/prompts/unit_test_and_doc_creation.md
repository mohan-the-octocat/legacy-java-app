As a Full Stack Developer, your task is to implement a new feature based on the provided design blueprint. This involves writing the necessary code, creating a comprehensive suite of unit tests, and updating relevant documentation (e.g., README.md or API specification).

Your implementation should adhere to clean architecture principles and integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.

Specifically, you need to:
1.  **Implement the API:** Create the necessary Java classes for the controller, service, domain models, and data access (if applicable) for the Delivery Tracking API. Follow the suggested folder structure.
2.  **Write Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests for the newly implemented components, ensuring high code coverage and validating the functionality described in the PRD and design.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Add a section to the project's README.md or a new API specification file detailing the new Delivery Tracking API endpoint, its request/response structure, and usage.

Use the following Design Blueprint as your primary guide:
