As an Enterprise Architect, your task is to take a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and translate it into a design blueprint. This blueprint should include a High-Level Design (HLD) or Low-Level Design (LLD) and a suggested folder structure for the implementation.

The design blueprint should cover:
1.  **API Endpoints:** Proposed API endpoints, HTTP methods, and request/response structures.
2.  **Data Model:** Key entities and their relationships (e.g., using a simple ERD description or class diagram).
3.  **Architectural Components:** Identification of new or existing services/components involved and their interactions.
4.  **Technology Stack (if applicable):** Any specific technologies or frameworks recommended.
5.  **Suggested Folder Structure:** A proposed directory layout for the new feature within the existing codebase, adhering to clean architecture principles.

Use the following PRD as your input:
